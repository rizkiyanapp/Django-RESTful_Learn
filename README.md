## Django - RESTful

This repository is used for learning to use RESTful APIs with Django. The learning objectives are to fulfill my curiosity and get understanding on how to use RESTful APIs with Django.

<br/>
Furthermore, I would like to build and present my own RESTful API using [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
